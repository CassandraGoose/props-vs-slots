# Comparison of a Navigation Component with Props vs a Navigation Component with Slots

## To Run
- `cd` into both projects
- `npm i` in both
- run `npm run serve` in both

## Compare and Contrast Each!

I like slots in this case because the Navigation component has so much less logic in it. Also, logic about teachers lives in the file that is called TeacherView and logic about the guardians lives in the GuardianView. 🤷‍♀️ My brain likes that.
